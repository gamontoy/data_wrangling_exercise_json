# data_wrangling_exercise_json

In this exercise we demonstrate how to read json files strings and tables, create normalized dataframes from nested strings, andother df manipulations.

Main tasks: 
Using data in file 'world_bank_projects.json' and the techniques demonstrated above,

1) Find the 10 countries with most projects
2) Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'theme_namecode')
3) In 2). above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.
